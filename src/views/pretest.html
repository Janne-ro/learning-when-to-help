            <p>If you have doubts, complaints, or questions about this study or about your rights as a research participant, you may contact UPF’s Institutional Committee for the Ethical Review of Projects (CIREP) by phone (+34 93 542 21 86) or by email (<a href="mailto:secretaria.cirep@upf.edu">secretaria.cirep@upf.edu</a>). CIREP is not part of the research team and will treat any information you send confidentially. </p>
            <p><strong>Funding body:</strong> This research is funded by the Spanish Research Agency (Agencia Estatal de Investigación, AEI), under the Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities of the Government of Spain, through the coordinated research project GENIE Learn: Human-Centered Generative AI-enhanced Smart Learning Environments (grant PID2023-146692OB-C33), with co-funding from the European Union (FEDER). The overall goal of the GENIE Learn project is to improve Smart Learning Environments (SLEs) for Hybrid Learning (HL) support by integrating Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools in a way that is aligned with the preferences and values of human stakeholders.</p>
            <p><strong>Objectives of the project:</strong> The goal of this study is to explore how generative AI can be used to support student learning in a way that enhances educational outcomes without creating dependence. While AI tools can provide personalized guidance, they may also affect how students engage with learning tasks. This study therefore seeks to identify when AI support is most helpful and how it can be used to promote effective learning, encourage thoughtful reflection, and maintain students’ independence. The insights from this research will help guide the responsible and educationally beneficial use of AI in learning environments.</p>
            <p><strong>Methodology and participation:</strong> <br />Participants in this study will take part in a controlled learning activity using a custom digital learning system that includes AI-based support, you may have access to.</p>
            <p>During the study, you will complete three learning tasks on topics related to social media and self-image, followed by an attention-shifting activity and an unassisted task to measure generalization of learning. Surveys and questionnaires will be administered before and after the tasks to assess your metacognitive awareness, understanding, confidence, and experience with the system.</p>
            <p>The study will collect the following data with participants’ consent: Task performance, interaction patterns with the system, demographic information (age, gender, education), free-text responses about your experience, and pre/post survey responses. This data will be used to evaluate learning outcomes, patterns of AI use, and the effectiveness of adaptive AI support in enhancing learning.</p>
            <p>The study is conducted in a group workshop setting. This means others will be aware of your presence in the experiment. Full anonymity can therefore not be guaranteed; however, all of your research data collected will be handled confidentially, pseudonymized, and reported only in aggregated or anonymized form.</p>
            <p>Participation is expected to take approximately 52 minutes and will take place in a controlled learning environment in a workshop setting.</p>
            <p><strong>Inclusion criteria:</strong> Participants must be <strong>over 18 and under 65</strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>Voluntary participation:</strong> Your participation in this study is on a voluntary basis and you may withdraw from the study at any time without having to justify your decision.</p>
            <p><strong>Risks and benefits:</strong> Participants face minimal risk. Possible risks include mild discomfort when completing tasks about self-image, or temporary frustration during challenging activities. Potential benefits include gaining insight into your own learning processes, receiving useful feedback from the system, and contributing to the development of improved educational tools that support effective and responsible use of generative AI.</p>
            <p><strong>Compensation:</strong> Your participation will be compensated with 10€ after having completed the full session. </p>
            <p><strong>Data protection:</strong> <br />In order to protect your privacy, your data will not be identified using your name or other direct personal identifiers, but will instead be associated with a coded identifier known only to members of the research team. Physical data will be stored in a locked, secure location, and digital data will be protected using access control systems so that they are accessible only to authorized research team members.</p>
            <p>The full dataset will be stored until the end of the evaluation period in August 2026. After the evaluation is completed, the data will be further processed and anonymized. Only anonymized data will be made publicly available and may be hosted or published in a public research repository.</p>
            <p>Although the research team will not be able to directly identify you from the dataset, complete re-identification cannot be fully excluded when demographic variables or multiple data sources are combined. For this reason, once the study has concluded and the dataset has been finalized for analysis and anonymization, it may no longer be possible to delete individual data upon request. In accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 2016/679 (EU), we provide the following information:</p>
            <p><strong>Data controller:</strong> Universitat Pompeu Fabra. C. de la Mercè, 12. 08002 Barcelona. Tel. +34 93 542 20 00. You can contact UPF’s Data Protection officer by sending an email to <a href="mailto:dpd@upf.edu">dpd@upf.edu</a>.</p>
            <p><strong>Purposes of the processing:</strong> Carrying out the above-mentioned research project. Personal data will be kept in full during the execution of the project and until the end of the evaluation period in August 2026. If a payment is involved, the necessary data will be kept in accordance with applicable regulation.</p>
            <p><strong>Legal basis:</strong> Your consent, which can be withdrawn at any time.</p>
            <p><strong>Recipients:</strong> Your personal data will only be processed by Universitat Pompeu Fabra and will not be transferred to third parties without your consent, except as otherwise provided by law. Data may be anonymized and published in an open science repository.</p> 
            <p><strong>Rights:</strong> As your data cannot be securely identified after completing the experiment, you will not be able to access your data and request their rectification or deletion. However, if at any point during the experiment you want to withdraw, your data will not be saved and immediately deleted. You can contact UPF’s Data Protection officer (<a href="mailto:dpd@upf.edu">dpd@upf.edu</a>) for any queries or if you feel that your rights are not properly respected. Should you not be satisfied, you may file a complaint with the Catalan Data Protection Authority (<a href="apdcat.gencat.cat">apdcat.gencat.cat</a>). </p>
